# Quick Overview

## Column 1

### Outline

Handling datasets is a skill that is central to many research areas. Managing, analysing and displaying data are challenging tasks that require learning specific software. In this workshop, you will be introduced to R and RStudio, one of the most versatile language and software environment for data analysis. The fact that this software is open-source makes it one of the most used statistical programming languages in scientific research at the moment. The workshop will teach you ‘hands-on’ to take your first steps in R and RStudio and prepare you to work with them in the professional research context.

Description of session contents

The training consists of four parts:

- R: You get to know the program R and its language by means of a number of examples. You practice with data management and datasets: reading data from other software (MS Excel, SPSS, …), changing/re-coding variables and other data management steps using the intuitive ‘tidyverse’ method. This will be all approached by making use of the power of creating RStudio projects.
- Graphs: You will learn to use R as a powerful tool to create different graphs via the package ‘ggplot2’.
- R Markdown/Quarto: You will learn to create reproducible documents (such as html reports, word docs and slides) so that you can integrate content (the explanations of the analyses and results) analyses (the way in which the results are produced (read: the underlying code) as well as the results themselves, nicely and easily, into one overall document.
- Basic analyses: finally, you will learn how to perform some of the most common analyses in R (correlations; t-test; linear regression analyses).

In the course we will schedule some time to work with your own research data (or with a dataset of us) so that you can immediately transfer what is learned to your owns projects.

# Part 1

## Column 1

### Outline

In the first part, we will introduce the basics of `R` language and the `RStudio` environment. 
Following topics will be discussed:

- What is R and why should you use R? 
- Install R & RStudio 
- RStudio interface 
- The basics in R 
- Installing and using packages
- Importing data 
- Working with R-projects

### Materials

#### Slides

The htlm-version of the slides for this first part can be found <a href="Presentations/Part1/Slides_part1.html" target="blank">here</a>

#### R script

There is an R-script (`Fruit.R`) that has all the code we used in this first part. Download it <a href="Fruit.R" target="blank">here</a> (Right-click and Save as)

# Part 2

## Column 1

### Outline

The second part of this workshop taps into the use of `Quarto` documents! Using `Quarto` you will be able to integrate your analyses (R-code & results) in a document (pdf, html, word, ppt, ...), unleashing the power to create reproducible lab-reports and slideshows.

These will be topics covered:

- What is Markdown? 
- Integrating Markdown and R code 
- Creating a basic Quarto document 

#### Slides

The htlm-version of the slides for this part can be found <a href="Presentations/Part2/Slides_Part2.html" target="blank">here</a>

#### Data

For this part, we will use a very small dataset `Fruit.RData`. The data can be downloaded <a href="Data/MarathonData.RData" target="blank"> here </a> (right-click to save as). 

## Column 2

### Example application

Quarto allows you to create nice documents like *lab-notes* or *walk-throughs*. For instance, I have created this document as an appendix of a paper. This is made with Quarto and is an html page that lives on the internet:

<a href="https://majestic-pixie-28398c.netlify.app/" target="blank"> Walk-through example 1 </a>

<a href="https://gifted-nightingale-d45b7e.netlify.app/#content" target="blank"> Walk-through example 2 </a>

# Part 3

## Column 1

### Outline

In this part of the workshop we introduce `dplyr` verbs. `dplyr` is a package that lives in the `tidyverse` that has powerfull functions to do some heavy lifting data wrangling operations. We will show how this package can be used to create new variables, select variables, filter cases, re-arrange datasets, merge datasets, ... 

#### Slides

The htlm-version of the slides for this first part can be found <a href="Presentations/Part3/Slides_Part3.html" target="blank">here</a>

#### Data

For this slideshow, we used a dataset called `Friends.RData`. The data can be downloaded <a href="Presentations/Part3/Friends.RData" target="blank"> here </a> (right-click to save as).

# Part 4

## Column 1

### Outline

Now everything is set to learn more about creating powerfull visualizations in `R`. To this end, we will introduce you the go-to package for visualizations in `R`: `ggplot2`.

These are the topics covered in this part:

- Simple plots in R 
- Grammar of graphics
- How `ggplot2` works (in a nutshell)
- Visualising a categorical variable
- Visualising a quantitative variable
- Visualising more than one variable
- More about visualisation? 

#### Slides

The htlm-version of the slides for this first part can be found <a href="Presentations/Part4/slides_part-4.html" target="blank">here</a>

#### Data

In this slideshow we make use of the `Pinguins` dataset that is part of the `palmerpenguins` package. So, the package `palmerpenguins` has to be installed and loaded to mimic the commands in the slides.

# Part 5

## Column 1

### Outline

Of course, `R` is not just a tool to do some data-wrangling and data-visualizations. It is a language to perform statistical analyses. In this final part we will show how some typical basic statistical analyses can be performed making use of `R`.

These are the topics covered in this part:

- Correlation
- t-test
- linear regression
- outro

### About Quarto

Quarto can be used for much more than just writing single documents. More info on all possibilities of Quarto can be found here:
<https://quarto.org/docs/guide/>

If you create a file (or a website) that you want to publish on internet there are many ways to do so. More information here:
<https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/>

You can even create a personal (academic) blog website with Quarto. Great tutorial can be found here:
<https://www.marvinschmitt.com/blog/website-tutorial-quarto/>

### Sven's website

When I find the time I write short posts about (Bayesian) statistics. Some of the topics touched upon in the workshop are also documented in these posts, where I try to explain certain concepts or workflows. These posts also contain the necessary code!
