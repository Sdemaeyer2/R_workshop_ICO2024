## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
Fruit <- c("Apples", "Bananas", NA)
```

::: callout-warning
You can add options to executable code like this `r mean(c(2,3,4))`
:::

```{r}
#| echo: false
Fruit
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed). **Another sentence printed in bold.**
